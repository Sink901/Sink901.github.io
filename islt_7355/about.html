<h3>About Me</h3>
<body>
<p>Hello!  My name is Zdena Sinkhorn. I am a 2024 graduate student in the <em>LIS program</em> at the University of Missouri. I am also working on a specialty in <strong>archival studies.</strong> My work background is in information preservation. This came out of my undergraduate studies at the College of Wooster from 2019-2022. My online college experience narrowed my career focus to public access to information. <br/><br/>Having only my computer and no in-person resources was a challenge. Inspired by the challenges I faced, I decided to dedicate my career to digital information. I hope to help archives and museums have better digital access. Better access means a better world, especially with the different technologies being created.

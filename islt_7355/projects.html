            <h2 class="Project1"><b>North Carolina Maritime Museum<br/> May 2021 to August 2021<br/>Collections Intern <br/><a href="https://ncmaritimemuseumbeaufort.com/"><img class="pic2" src=/islt_7355/images/NCMuseumIcon.png></a></b></h2>

	My time with the North Carolina Maritime Museum was on the shorter end, spanning three months over the summer of 2021. During this time, I gained valuable insight into the field of Collections Management as an intern with the Museum Collections Department. As a collections intern, I was responsible for two things: learning about the job expectations and requirements and doing the grunt work of processing artifacts, better known as accession in the museum world. This work gave me insight into how museums function. Artifacts do not simply appear in the relevant cases in museum exhibitions. There is a great amount of work and thought that goes into selecting materials and determining where they ought to go. I was lucky enough to participate in the process of collecting historical information to be used in the creation of a new exhibit. This was especially exciting to me given my interest in historical research and application. One of my biggest takeaways from the experience was learning about the importance of consistency in keeping records of artifacts. In any museum, it can be easy to lose track of how artifacts were acquired or where they are stored. By making sure that the records of the institution have the same format and labeling system, it becomes easier to process and store artifacts.

                    <h2 id="Project2"><b>Estes Park Museum <br/> December 2021 to January 2022<br/>Collections Intern<br/><a href="https://estespark.colorado.gov/museum"><img class="pic2" src=/islt_7355/images/EPIcon.jpg></a></b></h2><br/>
	I had a short-term internship over my college’s winter break with the Estes Park Museum in Estes Park, Colorado. While my time with this museum was very limited, I was able to gain a lot from my time with the institution. I was assigned the project of sorting out materials from the city’s old library that had been closed down. These materials varied greatly in content and material makeup.  By sorting the materials into rough thematic categories, I was able to provide the museum with a foundation to allow the public access to the materials again. This experience helped me to see the physical value of what I was contributing to the museum and the community.

            <h2 class="Project3"><b>Wooster Special Collections<br/> January 2019 to May 2022<br/>Librarian Apprentice<br/><a href="https://wooster.edu/library/sources/special-collections/"><img class="pic2" src=/islt_7355/images/COWIcon.png></a></b></h2><br/>
            During my work with the College of Wooster’s Special Collections, I was given the unique opportunity to create the baseline for my work in information science. I worked in what was essentially my school archive, processing new materials for the different collections and doing maintenance work on the materials we already had within the archive. My role included everything from assisting patrons with research questions to designing a completely new collection within the archive to help introduce new and relevant materials into the department. I learned so much from my time with the department and it gave me the basis for striving toward a career in the field of archives.

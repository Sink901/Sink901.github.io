    Hi everyone! My name is Zdena (Stina) Sinkhorn and I am in my second semester in the Library Sciences Masters Program here at the University of Missouri. Most of my experience with coding and computer science has been related to the user end of things. I have some limited background in metadata and website creation from an archival standpoint but am looking forward to expanding my knowledge about the field this semester. I really hope to walk away from this course with a clearer idea of the applications and limitations that these programming languages can have in library science. If all goes to plan, I am hoping to bring some of the skills I learn to future positions. I am currently living north of Denver, Colorado, and love to hike, play video games, and knit. Beyond that, I look forward to learning from and working with you all this semester!

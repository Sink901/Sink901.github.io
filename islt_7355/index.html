        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to Zdena Sinkhornâ€™s Professional Experience Website, built in Spring 2023 using HTML. I hope you find it informative and entertaining as you learn more about my background in the field of information sciences and archives. </p>
        <p>This website was designed with two goals in mind: to fulfill the Web Design and Development course expectations and to create a polished record of my work experience by using HTML. The site will begin on the next page with a brief background on myself and an overview of my educational background. It will then have a page where I discuss three of the most significant job positions I have held. My site will conclude with a reflection on what impact my career has had on my life outlook and what I hope to contribute to the field in the future. There are navigation guides at the bottom to allow you to follow through the contents of my site. At the end of the website will be a contact page for any additional questions or concerns you may have. </p>
